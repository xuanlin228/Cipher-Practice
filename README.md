# Cipher-Practice
The are three practices about cipher, one is the problem of caesar cipher in UVA, another is the problem of ancient cipher in UVA,
the other is use frequency analysis to decrypt an article.

## Environment
python 3.9.1

## Problem_1
* UVa 12604 - Caesar Cipher<br>
  * But my method would get the result of TLE on UVa.<br>

* UVa 1339 - Ancient Cipher<br>

## Problem_2
Use `alphabet_frequency.py` to do the frequency analysis to  calculate the count of each alphabet in order to decrypt an article, plaintext.txt.<br>
Then, in `problem2.py` to decrypt and write the decrpted answer into `decryptedText.txt`.<br>
